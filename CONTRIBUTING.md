# Contributing to Dotfiles

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this dotfiles repository! This guide will help you understand how to contribute effectively.

## üêõ Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the existing issues to avoid duplicates.

**When reporting a bug, please include:**
- Your operating system (macOS version, Linux distribution)
- Shell version (`zsh --version`)
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Any error messages or output
- Relevant configuration files

## üí° Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome! Please:
- Check if the enhancement has already been requested
- Provide a clear description of the feature
- Explain why it would be useful
- Include examples of how it would work

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Shell Script Standards
- Use `#!/bin/bash` or `#!/usr/bin/env zsh` shebangs
- Follow [Google Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)
- Use meaningful variable names in `UPPER_CASE` for globals
- Quote variables to prevent word splitting: `"$variable"`
- Use `[[ ]]` instead of `[ ]` for conditionals
- Include error handling with `set -e` when appropriate

### Code Style
```bash
# Good
if [[ -f "$HOME/.zshrc" ]]; then
    echo "Found zshrc file"
fi

# Bad
if [ -f $HOME/.zshrc ]
then
echo "Found zshrc file"
fi
```

### Testing
- Test your changes on a clean system when possible
- Ensure scripts work with both interactive and non-interactive shells
- Test symlink creation and removal
- Verify that rollback/backup functionality works

### Documentation
- Update README.md if you add new features
- Document any new configuration options
- Include examples in comments for complex functions
- Update WARP.md if changing project structure
